# React Hooks 

> Hooks is a something on react that gets caught every time the render function gets called. They will always point to the same piece of state because the hooks get called  in the same order every time the component renders. So the component can be stateful.

## Notes

### Use state hooks
- `useState` is the most common hooks on React, it allows us to create stateful component.
- This hooks, return an array with 2 values (the current state value and a function to update it)
- Example : 
```jsx
const [pizzaType, setPizzaType] = useState("pepperoni");
```
- We use the `setPizzaType` function in the `onChange` attribut of the input. Everytime the input is typed into, it's going to call that function with what has been typed or selected there. And then React will re-render the component with the new value of `pizzaType`.
