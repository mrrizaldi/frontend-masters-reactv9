# React Ecosystem 

## Notes

## TanStack Router
- TanStack Router is a powerful routing library for React applications. It provides type-safe routing, automatic code splitting, and a great developer experience.
- We installed `@tanstack/react-router` as a dependency and `@tanstack/router-devtools` & `@tanstack/router-plugin` as dev dependencies.

### Configuration
- We updated `vite.config.js` to include the TanStack Router plugin. This plugin automatically generates the route tree based on the file structure in the `src/routes` directory.
- The generated route tree is stored in `src/routeTree.gen.ts`. We should not edit this file manually.

### Setting up the Router
- In `src/App.jsx`, we replaced the manual component rendering with `RouterProvider`.
- We create a router instance using `createRouter` and pass the generated `routeTree`.
- We wrap the `RouterProvider` with `StrictMode` (optional but recommended).

### Creating Routes
- We created a `src/routes` directory to house our route components.
- **Root Route (`__root.jsx`)**: This is the main layout component that wraps all other routes. It's where we put global providers (like `CartContext`) and layout elements (like `Header` and `TanStackRouterDevtools`). It renders an `<Outlet />` where child routes will be displayed.
- **File-based Routing**: We use a naming convention like `index.lazy.jsx` for the home page and `order.lazy.jsx` for the order page. The `.lazy.jsx` extension indicates that these routes should be code-split and loaded lazily.

### Navigation
- We use the `<Link>` component from `@tanstack/react-router` for navigation.
- In `src/Header.jsx`, we wrapped the logo with a `<Link to="/">` to navigate back to the home page.

### DevTools
- We included `TanStackRouterDevtools` in our root route. This provides a visual interface to inspect the router state, current route, and more during development. It's automatically removed in production builds.
